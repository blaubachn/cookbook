# Cookbook

## Purpose

This cookbook is a simple list of recipes that can be filtered and searched made using react. I am writing the application for my mom's family's family cookbook, but I am writing it in a way that (I hope) is easily reusable.

## Setup

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then, if you understand them, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanblaubach/cookbook-web.git
cd cookbook-web
npm install
npm start
```
